# markdown-to-docx

Convert the README.md file in your repository to a Microsoft `*.docx` file.

## Usage

To use this action, add it as a step to your workflow:

```yml
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Release Job
    steps:
      ...
      - name: Generate readme document
        uses: tkottke90/markdown-to-docx
```

By default this will generate a file called `readme.docx` that can be opened in Microsoft Word

It is also possible to modify the name of the output file by adding the `output-name` input:

```yml
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Release Job
    steps:
      ...
      - name: Generate readme document
        uses: tkottke90/markdown-to-docx
        with:
          output-name: 'MyReadme.docx'
```

## Output

On its own this action does not do anything.  The file generated by this action is output to the current working directory of the workflow being executed.

It is up to the developer setting up this action to manipulate the file once it has been generated.
